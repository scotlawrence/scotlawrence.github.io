                      Iron, also known as "Russian Iron" was a special
                      type of metal used on
                      locomotive boilers from approximately the 1870's

                      widespread during those years, many Black &amp;
                      White builder photos still exist that show what is
                      quite clearly a shiny Russia Iron boiler jacket.
                      but..the photos were all in Black &amp; White,
                      because color photography wasn't in widespread use
                      until the 1940's and 50's.<br>

                      Russia Iron boiler jackets ran out their careers
                      and faded out during the 1910's, 20's and 30's,
                      and by the 40's they were basically extinct. Then,
                      after WWII, the hobby of model railroading really
                      picked up in popularity. By the 1950's, 60's, and
                      70's people wanted to model those "old time" turn
                      of the (20th) century locomotives. But wait..what
                      color was Russia Iron exactly? No one knew! the
                      actual locomotives were gone, and all the photos
                      were in Black and White. For half a century, roughly
                      1950 to the year 2000, the true color of Russia
                      Iron was temporarily lost to the model railroading
                      community! people "heard" is was probably blue,
                      perhaps from some old historic accounts. Then, the
                      model railroad manufacturers made the whole thing
                      *much* worse! by creating models like this:<br>

                  not known at the

                                          I started this page in 2009,
                                          and since then many fellow
                                          "snowblower
                                          enthusiasts" have emailed me,
                                          and posted on the <a href="http://www.snowblowerforum.com/">snowblower
                                            forum</a>, about
                                          restorations they have done to
                                          classic snowblowers! The

                                          snowblower hobby" is still
                                          quite small and obscure, not
                                          nearly as
                                          common as classic cars and
                                          restoring garden tractors or
                                          farm tractors,
                                          but it's catching on! <br>

                                          fabulous work
                                          guys have been doing with
                                          restoring old snowblowers. If
                                          you have one
                                          you would like to share, just

                                          is: original (or close to
                                          original)
                                          engine..no chinese clones.)<br>

                                          And while we are on the topic,
                                          what exactly qualifies as a
                                          "restoration"? <br>
                                          well, its a grey area! ;)
                                          somewhat subjective and open
                                          to
                                          interpretation. In my opinion,
                                          and for the purposes of this
                                          snowblower
                                          restoration page, a snowblower
                                          will count as "restored" or
                                          "refurbished" if it meets
                                          these qualifications:<br>
                                          <br>

                                          job! ;) parts that are worn
                                          out should be
                                          replaced, rust removed, engine
                                          improved as much as the owner
                                          is able.
                                          (some people can do a full
                                          engine rebuild, others might
                                          only have the
                                          tools and skills to do a carb
                                          clean and perhaps a carbon
                                          deposit clean
                                          for the engine head, others
                                          replace with a better engine
                                          of the same,
                                          or very close, model..skill
                                          levels and abilitys are all
                                          over the map,
                                          which is fine.)<br>
                                          <br>
                                          2. Engine should be original,
                                          or as close as possible to the
                                          original
                                          model. <br>
                                          (there is a <a href="https://scotlawrence.github.io/ariens/page10.html">seperate
                                            page</a> for engine
                                          swaps/replacements, which is
                                          really a different topic than
                                          a
                                          restoration.)<br>
                                          <br>
                                          The goal to work toward is to
                                          make the machine as close as
                                          possible to
                                          its original configuration! as
                                          close as you can to its "show
                                          room new"
                                          state. I don't require
                                          perfection! ;) (as I am hardly
                                          an experienced
                                          restorer myself) If it's
                                          greatly improved from its
                                          previous state,
                                          and the goal was to try to get
                                          it back to an original state,
                                          then that
                                          is what counts for me!<br>

                                rust, flaked paint, it needed some TLC,
                                and I thought if it's that

                                allocated $300 to restore it from the

                                  Chris had assumed his machine was a
                                  1964 model..but with a lot of
                                  emailing back and forth, we have come
                                  up with a theory that I believe
                                  pegs it as a 1962 model..<br>
                                  Chris's snowblower does not have its
                                  original engine..his dad replaced
                                  it back in the 80's.<br>
                                  So we dont have a tecumseh engine tag
                                  to date the machine..but Chris's
                                  cousin also bought a snowblower on the
                                  same day as his Dad, and Chris
                                  still has that engine! it has a
                                  tecumseh serial number of 2334, which
                                  means "the 334th day of 1962" which is
                                  December 1, 1962.<br>
                                  Thats the date the engine was
                                  assembled at Tecumseh..This would make
                                  the snowblower a very late 1962
                                  model..It's also possible that this
                                  engine was on a 1963 Ariens, and
                                  Chris' cousin bought a '63 while his
                                  father bought a "new '62" that hadnt
                                  been sold the pervious winter.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Chris also has a Tecumseh engine
                                  manual, that came with his snowblower
                                  when his dad bought it, that says
                                  "revised July 1963"..which would mea
                                  's snowblower is a
                                  very late 1962, built in December 1962
                                  or January 1963 (either way, it
                                  would still be a 1962 model) and since
                                  it was built so "late" it
                                  probably didnt sell that winter..it
                                  had to wait until the following
                                  autumn to be sold. So then Chris's
                                  father purchased the machine in the
                                  late summer or
                                  autumn of 1963, (when it was still
                                  brand new and only a few months old)
                                  which fits the "revised July 1963"
                                  notice on the tecumseh paperwork.
                                  Chris also has the original manuals
                                  that came with the machine! It came
                                  with both a 1962, and a 1963 manual!
                                  Forms ST-62-I-R and ST-63,
                                  which also supports the theory of "a
                                  1962 model bought in the autumn of
                                  1963" or perhaps even early 1964.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Another reason I believe this is a
                                  1962..it is now known that the
                                  "half-circle" scoop was only used in
                                  1960, 1961 and
                                  1962, and the "half teardrop" was used
                                  on 1963 and 1964 models..So this
                                  would have to be a 1962 model
                                  purchased the winter after it was
                                  built,
                                  late '63 or early '64, which is a very
                                  common phenomenon which still
                                  happens today.</font></font></font></td>

                                working at it a little at a time, and it
                                was&nbsp;basically apart, and

                                the weather report said we'd be in the

                                it outside due to the mess the
                                Rust-Oleum overspray makes, as it's very
                                slow drying, and sticks to everything.</small></div>

                                so much easier to use,
                                and 'inspire' checking the oil! The red

                                designed to keep snow/water/ice
                                from plugging the vent hole. The
                                original is painted metal with a
                                crossed cover welded on over the vent

                                it. I found out just how important the
                                cover is, as the cross fell off
                                my father's old machine, and as I was
                                using it, ice formed on the hole,
                                and it vapor locked and died!</small></div>

                                there is a difference in how much faster

'off-white'
on
                                this machine was done using Krylon Gloss
                                Ivory (#51504)
                                over a red oxide primer. With it not
                                being an 'engine enamel', some
                                discoloring occurred around the muffler
                                area, but it's well hidden by
                                the carb heater box. After painting the
                                whole engine, I thought about
                                the gas tank, and any spills will likely
                                affect the paint. One thing
                                I've learned is to 'heat cure' paint,
                                and it's durability and
                                resistance to chemicals improves
                                dramatically. Knowing that gas tank
                                was absolutely gas free, I spent some
                                time heating it up with a heat
                                gun a half dozen times to the point it
                                felt hot; my estimate around
                                200�. I did find out it worked, as gas
                                was spilled on it, and
                                didn't affect the paint.</small></div>

                                to deal with&nbsp;of this era machine
                                are the handlebar
                                panels with the Ariens embossed
                                logo.&nbsp;Finding a nice one isn't
                                easy, if not impossible, as they are
                                thin aluminum, and are usually
                                bent, cracked, faded and corroded.
                                Restoring one really isn't an option
                                with the raised decaled embossing and
                                thin material.&nbsp;They are a
                                discontinued item, but Ariens has a
                                'replacement',&nbsp;and they're
                                about $100. They are not like the
                                original, as it's a panel they used
                                on a rototiller, and they 'fit', but are
                                made and look totally
                                different.&nbsp;The one on this '69 is
                                the best I could find, and with
                                a little straightening, epoxying two
                                small cracks, and a touch-up of
                                the off white along the top and bottom
                                edges, it was 'just
                                presentable'. The old part number is
                                002033000, and is superseded with
                                Ariens #50203400, which is an

thing
my
                                father did the first year was to remove
                                the panel from the
                                handlebars, as it 'got in his way trying
                                to pull start the engine'. It
                                ended up in&nbsp;his tool room at the
                                old farm house, only for me to
                                rediscover it in 2012, in excellent
                                condition. It was
                                different,&nbsp;as the '65/'66 model
                                year&nbsp;had the mounting holes
                                (slots)&nbsp;only a quarter of the way
                                down from the top edge, with
                                later versions having the holes on
                                center. Also, it was an almond
                                color, and the paint was very nice. I
                                matched the color to Rust-Oleum
                                Almond (#7770), and this panel is
                                now&nbsp;on a&nbsp;partially restored
                                1971 7/32, now in the possession of
                                Scot. I looked up the part number,
                                and Ariens Parts Radar shows the same
                                number as the later panels that I
                                mentioned in the previous paragraph,
                                which means this earlier design is
                                not available, either.&nbsp;That's one

other
'tough
                                aspect' of this era are the chromed
                                handlebars. The decent
                                ones I used were cleaned up to look as
                                good as I could get them, but
                                they're far from perfect. I
                                talked&nbsp;to my Ariens dealer if
                                they're
                                still available, and they are, but the
                                right hand lower now
                                only&nbsp;comes painted black. They're
                                quite expensive,
                                too.&nbsp;Re-chroming is also very
                                costly, and having a set that's not
                                rusty &amp; pitted to start with is
                                important, as the work to get the
                                tubes smooth and pit-free is an extra
                                plating&nbsp;cost. Some machines
                                from the late '60s came with the almond
                                or off-white painted bars that
                                I've found&nbsp;are on machines that
                                came without the factory
                                differential option. Having decent used
                                painted bars make it a bit
                                easier to do a repaint, as the chromed
                                bars would have to be sent to a
                                plating shop to have the old chrome
                                removed if you wanted to just paint
                                them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></div>

                                attention. With all I did,
                                documenting this would have resulted in
                                having&nbsp;almost 100

                                condition, but I did dismantle it
                                for the basic rebuild and cleaning,
                                lapped the valves, new gaskets,
                                rings, connecting rod, and such, because
                                I had them on hand already. It

                                far. I had it in my
                                shop&nbsp;covered up with old blankets
                                in a lineup with 5 other old
                                Ariens machines, just to be able to say
                                'which one do you want'. Eric
                                was suspicious, as he's known me for
                                years with all the classic and
                                muscle car work I've done (including his
                                own&nbsp;big block Chevelle
                                SS), so when I took the cover
                                off,&nbsp;Tom saw it, and he said 'I
                                think I&nbsp;want that one',
                                and&nbsp;was thrilled. Many discussions,
                                stories and 'silly name calling' erupted
                                from that point, as this
                                machine had been on the Snow Blower
                                Forum and our Ariens Dealer's home
                                page for almost 4 weeks at this point,
                                and I could finally tell them!
                                It got put to use&nbsp;two days
                                later&nbsp;with our first real snow
                                storm, and it did what an Ariens
                                does....and did it very well!</small></div>

                                      everything in the more modern

                                              Good evening and thanks a
                                              lot for your excellent
                                              website! Last year I
                                              picked up a 1970 Ariens
                                              Sno-Thro (24" cut) off
                                              Craigslist for $140 and
                                              it worked awesome last
                                              winter. Since it was a bit
                                              rusty all over, I
                                              wanted to restore the
                                              entire machine, so that's
                                              what I've been doing
                                              the past couple weeks. I
                                              completely disassembled
                                              and am sandblasting
                                              all of the sheet metal and
                                              engine components, will
                                              prime and repaint,
                                              etc. They built these
                                              machines so well that it's
                                              a shame to have them
                                              rust away. Mine is a 1970
                                              model with model number
                                              10962 Sno-Thro
                                              Transmission and 10995
                                              Sno-Thro Attachment
                                              (blower).<br>
                                              <br>
                                              I disassembled the
                                              transmission/friction
                                              drive system just enough
                                              so I
                                              could get it out of the
                                              sheet metal housing.
                                              Unfortunately, I didn't
                                              take the best record of
                                              where a couple of the
                                              bushings are supposed to
                                              go. Had I been thinking
                                              better beforehand, I
                                              probably should have taken
                                              some digital pictures of
                                              the entire inside and made
                                              a record of where
                                              each part came from. I
                                              should know better...I'm a
                                              mechanical engineer

                                              I just finished up my 1970
                                              Ariens this morning and
                                              took these photos. I
                                              ended up taking the entire
                                              snowblower and engine
                                              apart, sandblasted
                                              every part, primed,
                                              repainted, and
                                              clear-coated with actual
                                              Ariens
                                              Orange paint. I replaced
                                              the belt, muffler, all
                                              engine gaskets,
                                              crankshaft seals, all
                                              fasteners, etc. After all
                                              the parts had been
                                              cleaned, I regreased
                                              everything, so I think
                                              it's operating smoother
                                              than ever. I had to have
                                              the blower sheet metal
                                              welded in a couple
                                              areas and then bought a
                                              new blade, too. As you can
                                              see, I went with the
                                              look of the new machines
                                              with black engine
                                              components and augers, but
                                              overall it turned out
                                              great.</small></span></small></font></font></font></small></p>

8/24
                                Model #924040; Serial #004303<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                I started this project as a gift for my
                                brother John, as he was in need
                                of a decent sized snow blower at his
                                horse farm. It's what I refer to
                                as a 'Big Wheel' design, as it uses a
                                tire and rim twice as large as
                                the standard size. What Ariens did to
                                accommodate the 'Big Wheel' with
                                the axle in the same location is a story
                                in itself. My brother's long
                                driveway isn't paved, and the need to be
                                in 'off-road' mode made this
                                machine a better fit to his terrain.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                The decision to make it 'look better'
                                didn't happen until it was
                                partially dismantled to service
                                everything, and it seemed the 'right
                                thing to do' as it was for my brother
                                after all. My shop is set up for
                                doing classic and muscle car
                                restorations, as that's been my niche
                                for
                                many decades, so I just couldn't help
                                but to just go after every part.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                Also, having already done the tractor
                                portion of a 1971 Ariens 7/32
                                (now owned by the author of this web
                                site, Scot), I had a feel for the
                                approach, techniques and materials
                                needed, and the knowledge that
                                reproduction decals were available. I
                                also have a bit of a 'collection'
                                of older Ariens, including parts
                                machines and new parts, as I've been
                                fixing them up for others to have. (A
                                little bit of an Ariens junk yard
                                going on here....).<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                Finding aerosol paint to match original
                                Ariens colors is a bit tough.
                                The orange and off white shades changed
                                through the years, so there's a
                                few shades to seek out. The orange of
                                choice for me was what I had
                                plenty of; Chevy Engine Enamel Orange,
                                and the most durable, but not
                                easiest to work with, was Rust-Oleum
                                (#248941). I mention that it's not
                                the easiest to work with, due to the
                                overspray will stick to everything
                                in your shop, and it's a slow drying
                                paint. (Note; There's a Chevy
                                Orange-Red that is too dark/red). The
                                Ariens 'off-white' of this era is
                                more of a 'dirty white', and through
                                trial and error, I ended up using
                                Rust-Oleum Biscuit Appliance Epoxy
                                (#210372) as it's a little lighter
                                than the ivory. The Biscuit isn't an
                                engine enamel, and is affected by
                                the engine heat near the muffler, and
                                will discolor somewhat, but is
                                covered by the carb heater box.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                The plated levers and rods were prepped
                                and painted with Krylon Matte
                                Aluminum (#51519) as it replicates the
                                original plating nicely. It
                                looks great, but isn't a high quality
                                paint, and isn't resistant to
                                oils. Even after it's dry, rubbing it
                                will result in a dulling, but
                                otherwise it's a decent choice. There's
                                other silver paints that are
                                more durable, it's a matter of choice.
                                Bare aluminum parts that were
                                glass beaded or wire wheeled got a coat
                                of clear. The muffler was
                                sandblasted and painted with Eastwoods
                                exhaust paint, but black or
                                silver high heat header/manifold paint
                                is cheaper.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                Anything that would fit in my
                                sandblasters got blasted, including the
                                handlebars. I thought about having the
                                auger housing and auger rakes
                                professionally sandblasted, but decided
                                to just go after them with wire
                                wheels and power sanders. This was the
                                toughest and most time
                                consuming, but it did give decent
                                results. Rust and pitting is
                                something to address with 'how nice' do
                                you want it to be when you're
                                done. I did use some auto body skim coat
                                fillers on things like the
                                handlebar banner panel, the carb heater
                                box, engine fan shroud and head
                                top shield. I kept telling myself, 'this
                                machine is going to get used
                                like it was meant to be', but the
                                results were what I wanted. All in
                                all, it took 8 cans of orange and 4 cans
                                of Biscuit, with an average of
                                3~4 coats, to do this machine.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                The auger assembly and housing have many
                                angles and challenges to
                                getting everything painted in one shot.
                                I did the auger assembly using
                                an old end table that I drilled a 1"
                                hole in the center, and after
                                painting the back of the impeller/fan, I
                                placed it with the
                                bearing/pulley shaft through the hole,
                                and it sits there nicely on the
                                impeller/fan backside. As you paint, you
                                can rotate the auger rakes by
                                (slowly) spinning it on its shaft, which
                                in turn, rotates the rakes so
                                you can see and get to all the surfaces,
                                nooks and crannies. For the
                                housing, I inverted a metal garbage can
                                and placed an appropriate sized
                                piece of plywood on it that will
                                fit/support the housing mounting area.
                                I painted the housing mounting area
                                first, let it dry for a while, then
                                turned it over and set it on the plywood
                                with the bucket facing
                                straight up. I did all this outside on a
                                warm, calm day, well away from
                                the ill affects of the overspray. If you
                                have a spray booth, that's
                                even better!<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                I did make a few modifications, as the
                                improvements were to my liking.
                                The most obvious is the use of a
                                discharge chute from a 1994 Ariens
                                ST824, Model #924082. It's a newer
                                design that's a bit straighter at
                                the base, and about 4" taller, it's a
                                direct fit, with the addition of
                                a 4th retaining shoe. I've used one on
                                my '78 8/32, and the improvement
                                is noticeable. I also added an extended
                                dipstick to help 'inspire' the
                                checking of the oil before each use.
                                Just for a custom touch, I painted
                                the choke pull and the primer bulb base
                                orange. I used non-original
                                hardware in many places with stainless
                                and nylon lock nuts. The
                                original Flange Whizlock nuts and bolts
                                are available at certain
                                hardware stores, which I ended up
                                coating with some clear paint brushed
                                on, just because 'rust never sleeps'.
                                The skid shoes are the new design
                                that's double sided, as the originals
                                were single. One decal bothered
                                me that Tecumseh applied to the carb
                                heater box; the Tecumseh
                                information decal at the rear corner
                                originally faced rearward, and I
                                felt it to be harder to read, and just
                                didn't look right....so I
                                rotated it 90� to face the left side of
                                the machine.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                The engine and carb got a full rebuild,
                                even though it didn't really
                                need it....it was all apart, and I had
                                all the rebuild parts on hand.
                                All bearings, bushings and wear items
                                throughout the machine are new.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                When I started putting decals on, it
                                took me over 2 hours. (I'm sure
                                they didn't spend that much time at the
                                Ariens factory....but, they
                                sure 'look it' with random crooked
                                ones). Laying out the location on
                                the handlebar panel was the toughest.
                                The dash control ones would have
                                been easier to apply before it was
                                assembled, as the levers are a bit
                                hard to work around. The plastic emblem
                                on the auger housing needed the
                                white lettering redone.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                I've saved many decals on other machines
                                that were still in great
                                condition. I would cover them with Duct
                                tape before blasting or power
                                sanding, leaving 1/8" ~ 1/4" of paint
                                around them to hand sand/feather
                                edge after removing the Duct tape. Then,
                                regular masking tape before
                                painting, trimming with a razor blade at
                                their edges. Note; remove the
                                masking tape before the paint is
                                completely dry, usually within 24
                                hours. Be aware that unmasking can start
                                to peel the decal itself off.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                With it all done, I just felt good about
                                it, and really enjoyed doing
                                it, as it's in me to 'Dare to be
                                Different', and bringing an old rusty
                                Ariens back to it's original glory is
                                gratifying.....<br>

                                My brother used it for the first time a
                                few weeks ago with our first
                                real snow of the season, and said it
                                performed great!<br>

                              this gem of an ad that was
                              already a month old and though I knew the
                              unit had likely been sold
                              already, added "Yes- I'm interested if you
                              still have" to the heading
                              in my reply and it turns out the guy had a
                              hundred emails, but had to
                              go away on business right after he placed
                              the ad and mine was the first
                              one (and most current response) that
                              caught his eye.<br>
                              <br>
                              Here's the body of his ad (might belong in
                              the best of Craigslist --
                              lol) Needless to say, his wife was not

                                  this item used about four years
                                  ago, and it continues to be a total
                                  stalwart workhorse for me. Starts
                                  up on first or second pull, and
                                  seriously throws snow like it's angry
                                  about something. Oh, I'm not gonna lie
                                  about it. It's one of the
                                  ugliest monstrosities you'll ever see.
                                  It's old, shows the wear, and as
                                  of this past off-season, requires its
                                  left tire to be patched or
                                  replaced. In a lot of ways, it's like
                                  my mother in-law. She's the
                                  ugliest b**** you'll ever meet, and
                                  simply will not DIE. The carburetor
                                  has had a tiny leak since the day I
                                  bought it. But the reality is -
                                  they just don't make them like this
                                  thing anymore. It's SOLID and you
                                  can tell just from feeling it that
                                  it's built the way these machines
                                  are supposed to be built.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The $80 is firm, and requires you to
                                  come out my way to pick her up.
                                  She's big and heavy, so have a pickup
                                  and a ramp if you plan on taking
                                  her. If you're handy, I'm betting you
                                  can get this thing back to peak
                                  performance for just a few bucks. As
                                  it is now, it runs well (with the
                                  tire issue noted).<br>
                                  <br>

                              Now even though this is a 30 year-old
                              machine, they are indeed
                              workhorses and routinely sell for $300-500<br>
                              <br>
                              My buddy Eric helped me pick her up with
                              his Dodge Ram Pickup Truck
                              that night (It was Voting day) and she
                              started on the second pull. Tire
                              was off the rim and he'd said the electric
                              start didn't work. As soon
                              as I got the unit home I went to see if
                              the tire just needed reseating
                              (there were a few cups of water in the
                              tire) -- and I was able to
                              successfully reseat it.&nbsp; Also, the
                              Sno Thro had the optional
                              electric starter option, which supposedly
                              didn't work -- wanna bet? <br>
                              <br>
                              So I proceeded to disassemble the tractor
                              from the bucket and all
                              related components including bearings and
                              auger assembly. Time to
                              remove all the rusty bits down to the bare
                              metal, including all of the
                              motor sheet metal pieces, and commenced
                              painting and sanding operations
                              (over the course of 2 weeks -- outside
                              when weather permitted --
                              otherwise inside). Multiple coats of
                              primer, plus 3-4 coats of
                              Chevrolet Orange Engine Enamel
                              (Rustoleum). Love it when a project
                              comes together.&nbsp; Oh, also treated her
                              with a fresh oil change of
                              Royal Purple in the engine and synthetic
                              gear lube for the Auger
                              differential/worm gear and greased all
                              parts, adjusted the reduction
                              gear chains, etc. Carb only needed
                              adjustment and the standing water
                              removed from the tire that came off the
                              rim and cleaned up the rim bead
                              surface of the wheel and tire.<br>
                              <br>
                              Also, like I said, this would appear to be
                              an extremely early build for
                              this model, as it is a 924050, serial #
                              000117 (they start at 000101)
                              and the bucket is the third off the line
                              (model 824007, Serial # 000103
                              - which would make it the 3rd off the
                              line! (see attached pics)<br>

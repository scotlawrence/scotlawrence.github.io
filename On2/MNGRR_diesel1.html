                    the American 2-footers..the type of locomotives that

              <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">Built in
                    1956, only 7 years
                    after the three 2-footer GE's.</font></font>
              </p>
              <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">Based on
                    the builders plate
                    evidence, and the book that states "</font></font><b><font
                    color="#000099">Light
                    locomotives were produced for a period at GE's

                    In my opinion it is very logical to conclude that
                    the three 2-foot GE's
                    were</font></font>
                <br>
                <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">built at
                    Schenectady, and
                    not Erie. There are clearly builders plates that say
                    both Schenectady and
                    Erie, and I think it is safe to conclude the city on
                    the plate reflects
                    the city where the unit was built.</font></font>
              </p>
              <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1">So there
                    it is..im going
                    to presume "built at Schenectady"..since that seems
                    the most logical based
                    on all the evidence...unless proven otherwise.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In 1949, three 2-foot gauge
diesel locomotives were built by GE in Schenectady, NY.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>for the Whitin Machine Works
in Whitinsville, Mass.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The three locomotives are
of an identical design, and are 23 Ton GE switchers.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">(I found an on-line
reference that said they were built at Erie..but that is incorrect, the
builders plates say </font>Schenectady.)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">(I have also seen
them listed as 25 ton..that is also incorrect..they are 23 ton)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The three locomotives were
built for the Whitin Machine Works, were built new as 2-foot gauge locomotives,
and are the only 3 locomotives of this specific design ever built.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>23 ton</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>50" (4' 2") wide maximum
(for clearance inside the Whitin Machine Works.)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>150 HP</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Classified by GE as type:
B-B-46/46-4GHM844</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Today they are 84" wide (7
feet) due to the side walkways on #1 and #2 that were added&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>by Edaville. The Whitin
photo above shows their original configuration without the walkways.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The numbering scheme of the
three locmotives while at Whitin is currently unknown, but we can see by
the above photo that one of them was given the number 5.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Which Whitin road numbers
correspond to the future numbers 1,2 and 3 is unknown.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The three units toiled in
relative obscurity inside the Whitin Machine Works until 1967, when Whitin
closed its doors for good. The three units were then put up for sale. They
all quickly found new careers!</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Locomotive #1 (the current
#1) was brought to Edaville in 1967.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Locomotive #2 (the current
#2) was also brought to Edaville a few years later.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Locomotive
#3 (the current #3) took a more adventurous path than her two sisters..She
was used by "Steam Village Railroad" in Gilford, NH for a time in the 1970's.
Number 3 also once belonged to "Koppers"..a railroad tie manufacturer.
Im not sure of the exact dates for #3's Koppers and "Steam Villiage Railroad"
careers, but its clear she must have worked for "Steam Village Railroad"
first, then Koppers, because today her cab side is still lettered for Koppers.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1><font color="#000000">Finally,
in 1980, number 3 was ready to settle down and join her two sisters at
Edaville, but s</font>adly, she was severely damaged by a low bridge during
the move by truck to Edaville in 1980, she was not repaired and never operated
again.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Today, all three locomotives
still exist!</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1># 2 remains at Edaville to
this day, and is still operating.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1># 1 was moved to the Maine
Narrow Gauge Museum in Portland Maine on September 19, 1993</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>and operates today as the
main workhorse for the MNGRR.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The damaged # 3 was also
moved to Portland, where she continues to be used as a parts source for
her two operating sisters.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>A short article about these
engines, with "as built" drawings, appeared in the November 1974 issue
of Railroad Model Craftsman. A second article appeared in the April 1983
issue of RMC:</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>"Edaville's diesels: a scratchbuilding
project in On2"</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>the second article has updated
drawings, showing the wide walkways that were added by Edaville.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I visited the MNGRR in Portland
on August 14, 2004, and took many detail shots of Diesel 1 as an</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>aid for future modeling
of this engine. I plan to build this engine in <a href="https://scotlawrence.github.io/29n2/index.html">29n2
scale</a>, or maybe On2 (or both)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>the guys over on the
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MaineOn2/">On2
forum</a> got to talking about these engines, and modeling 2-foot diesels,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>so I put this page together
to benefit all modelers and anyone interested.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>My pictures were shot on
film, and it was an overcast, cloudy day, as a result, shadow detail was
lacking...so I had to mess with the contrast and lightness to bring out
details...as a result, many of these photos appear a bit murky..but I did
that purpose so the detail can be seen for modeling..</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>these are "record" shots..not
fine art! ;)</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>oh yeah..and why did I refer
to these three locomotives as "Big"? as in: The "Big" diesels of the modern
New England 2-footers?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Because even though they
are very </font><b><font size=-2>SMALL</font></b><font size=+1> locomotives,
as locomotives go, they are the LARGEST diesels ever used on American 2-foot
railroads! There are many very small "critters" in use by the various 2-foot
museums and historical societies, small 4-wheel gas Whitcombs and the like,
but these three GE's represent the only real "mainline" diesel power of
the American 2-footers..the type of locomotives that <i>might</i> have
been used by the real 2-footers as mainline power if any had survived beyond
WWII and into the diesel era..that makes them the BIG diesels of the Modern
New England 2-footers! :)</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Update!</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>January 2008.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I said at the top of this
page:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">(I found an on-line
reference that said they were built at Erie..but that is incorrect, the
builders plates say </font>Schenectady.)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I assumed that if the plate
says Schenectady, the unit was built at Schenectady, and not Erie.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I later recieved an email
stating that is incorrect..even though the plate says Schenectady, the
units were actually built at Erie...hmm..I dont know.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Were all GE switchers built
at Erie? even though the plates say Schenectady?</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>did the plates say Schenectady
only because GE was headquartered there at the time?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Or..were some switchers actually
built at Schenectady..(and those plates say Schenectady on them)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>while were others built
at Erie? and if a unit was built at Erie, would the plate SAY Erie?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>several posibilities:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>1. all units built at Erie,
but all plates say Schenectady anyway. </font><font size=-1>(because GE
was based in Schenectady)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>2. some built in Schenectady,
some in Erie, but all plates say Schenectady anyway.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>3. some built in Erie, some
in Schenectady, and plates reflect the place unit was built.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some
plates say Erie, some plates say Schenectady.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>number 3 seems the most logical
to me,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>but number 1 or 2 would
need to be true if our 2-footer GEs were built at Erie but the plates</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>say Schenectady.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I dont know the answer!</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>So I posted a question on
the <a href="http://www.railroad.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=498314">GE
forum at railroad.net</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I recieved a reply stating:</font></font>
<p><b><font color="#000099">Scot:&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000099">The Second Diesel Spotters Guide has a brief
sentence on page GE-137 which says "Heavy Locomotives have always been
produced at the GE plant at Erie, Pa. Light locomotives were produced for
a period at GE's Schenectady plant."&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000099">Not definitive for this locomotive but makes
it plausible.&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000099">Bill</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>thats helps!</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>based on that, I went looking
for photos of GE builders from roughly the same era that say "Erie".</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>found one!</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>here is the plate:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1><a href="http://www.wpyr.com/railfancorner/engineplate.html">http://www.wpyr.com/railfancorner/engineplate.html</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>From this locomotive:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1><a href="http://www.whitepassfan.net/whitepass/engines/dieselengines/class90/93.html">http://www.whitepassfan.net/whitepass/engines/dieselengines/class90/93.html</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Built in 1956, only 7 years
after the three 2-footer GE's.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Based on the builders plate
evidence, and the book that states "</font></font><b><font color="#000099">Light
locomotives were produced for a period at GE's Schenectady plant."</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>
In my opinion it is very logical to conclude that the three 2-foot GE's
were</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>built at Schenectady, and
not Erie. There are clearly builders plates that say both Schenectady and
Erie, and I think it is safe to conclude the city on the plate reflects
the city where the unit was built.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>So there it is..im going
to presume "built at Schenectady"..since that seems the most logical based
on all the evidence...unless proven otherwise.</font></font>

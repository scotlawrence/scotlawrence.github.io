<td><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This tour begins with...my wedding!
:)</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The lovely miss Debbie and I were married
on September 24, 2005. For our Honeymoon we traveled for 2 weeks through
Vermont and Maine, visiting Northern Vermont, The Baxter St. Park and Mount
Katahdin area of North Central Maine. Over to the coast to visit Bar Harbor
and Acadia Park, and finishing up at Boothbay Harbor then heading home.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Deb and I have always been huge fans
of New England, and Maine in particular. In fact, it was because of our
travels to Maine that I first discovered the Maine 2-footers!&nbsp;</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This trip was very much NOT focused
on trains! ;) It may not look like it from this webpage,but visiting train
sites was a VERY small part of our trip..yes, I visited 2 museums,but they
were both closed (it was a weekday both times) so I just stopped, hopped
out of the car, and took a few shots..&nbsp; im focusing on the train pictures
with this page because im making it to share the train pictures with railfans!
(there is <i>another</i> album of wedding and honeymoon pictures, for friends
and family, that doesnt have a single train photo in it! ;)</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">on with the tour!</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After 2 days in beautiful northern Vermont,
visiting Montpelier, Ben &amp; Jerrys factory</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">tour! and some hiking in the mounains,&nbsp;
we had a long drive over to Millinocket, Maine. Rangeley and Phillips were
on the way.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(I didnt find the Rangeley station,
but I didnt look very hard for it either..</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">maybe next time) but! I found the Phillips
station! The best surviving relic of the original Sandy River &amp; Rangeley
Lakes Railroad.</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Arriving in Millinocket.</font></b>

Baxter State Park, but we encountered our one</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and only rainy day of the entire 2-week
trip, so we just stayed at the lodge and drove</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">into town for dinner. We went to the
local library, (Deb loves her books!) and I went</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and looked for local railroad books.
I found a book that listed EVERY surviving</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">railroad structure in the state of
Maine! I discovered the Millinocket train station</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">was gone, but a roundhouse still existed!
So I asked the libraian for local maps,</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">discovered where the yard was, and
drove over!</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway
train sits in the Millinocket yard.</font></b>

(our whole trip had amazing weather!)</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">sunny, crisp, about 70 degrees..perfect!</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We knew that hiking to the top of Katahdin
was "out of our league"..and we didnt have enough daylight anyway for a
hike that long. So we went through the book, and selected a hike that was
rated "moderate"..</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"ok for kids" it said in the book..</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">yeah right.. it nearly killed us! ;)</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">very strenuous hike!</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but we finally made it to the top of
Sentinel mountain..it was worth it!</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After a few days in the "shadow of Katahdin"
we headed over to Bar Harbor and Acadia.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">no trains there! ;)</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(although I did find a very cool book
about the "Green Mountain Railway" of Acadia park. a cog railway up to
the top of Cadillac mountain! see <a href="http://www.mylargescale.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=34001">this</a>

railroad to Bar Harbor??</font></b>

<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last day of our trip..we stayed over
at Boothbay Harbor.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">naturally, I had to drive over to Wiscasset!</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The last time we drove through Wiscasset
I had just bought a book on the WW&amp;F at the Boothbay RR museum store,
mere minutes before, and I didnt know anything about the WW&amp;F then..</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">this time, I knew what to look for!</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is the exact site where the 2-foot
gauge Wiscasset, Waterville &amp; Farmington crossed over the Standard
gauge Maine central.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the 2-foot tracks are long gone, but
the standard gauge tracks remain.</font></b>

the dual-gauge crossing.</font></b>

left once held the WW&amp;F station.</font></b>

its amazing these relics are still visible after 72 years. This view is

there is no trace of the railroad at all, and the site is a baseball field
for the elementary school just up those stairs to the left.&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have read that the concrete ring
of the turntable pit is still intact! simply buried under the baseball
field, and that during a dry summer a ring of dry grass can be seen in
right-field marking the turntable pit.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

Pennsylvania
is
a
daughter
of
the
Iron
Horse..She
was
born
in
the
1870's
when
the
Lehigh
Valley
Railroad
arrived
from
the
south,
                      to interchange coal with the Erie railroad in
                      nearby
                      Waverly, NY. Sayre was a major junction point of
                      three different
                      railroads (that would all eventually become part
                      of the LV system) and
                      being such a strategic location, it was perfect
                      for a major yard, shops
                      and maintenance terminal for the new railroad.
                      Sayre became the "heart"
                      of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and the town grew
                      quickly along with
                      the railroad, through the later decades of the
                      19th
                      Century.<br>

Sayre's
                      "main street"
                      is Desmond street, named after Thomas Desmond, who
                      was the assistant
                      superintendent of the Lehigh Valley Railroad at
                      the time that the
                      railroad was building into Sayre. Thomas Desmond
                      passed away in 1873,
                      right at the moment that Sayre's first streets
                      were being planned and
                      laid out.
                      Sayre itself is named after Robert H. Sayre, who

                    By 1880,
                    what we know today as
                    downtown Sayre was well underway. The current Sayre
                    passenger station
                    was
                    completed in 1881, and the Desmond street business
                    district buildings
                    were being built by that time as well. By 1900 Sayre
                    was a thriving
                    town.</big></big><big style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><big><br>
                    <br>
                    Part of the original downtown Sayre included a
                    beautiful small town
                    park, known as "Desmond Street Park", this park
                    existed for about 80
                    years (about 1880 to 1959), it occupied the space
                    between
                    the railroad station and the downtown business
                    district, tying the
                    important passenger station and the rest of downtown
                    together into one
                    pleasing scene.<br>
                    <br>
                    This was a much loved park, and many Valley
                    residents still remember it
                    fondly from their youth, waiting for family members
                    arriving by train,
                    waiting for Dad to get out of work at the Sayre
                    shops, and simply
                    enjoying the park as downtown bustled around them.<br>
                    <br>
                    But times changed..by the late 1950's passenger
                    service on the LV was
                    ending, and some felt the park could be better used
                    to increase
                    commerce in town..at the time, this was considered
                    "progress" and many
                    probably just accepted it, (although it is also
                    known that many were
                    dismayed at the loss of the park!) A large new
                    business opened in
                    downtown Sayre in 1960, the J.J. Newberry company,
                    who owned a chain
                    of department stores around the USA. The Newberry's
                    building took over
                    the entire space once occupied by Desmond Street
                    Park. <br>
                    <br>
                    Newberry's in Sayre thrived through the 1960's, 70's
                    and 80's, but by
                    the 1990's business slowed and eventually the store
                    (and the entire
                    Newberry's chain) closed down. A dollar store then
                    opened in the
                    building, but that also eventually closed. By 2012
                    (and the writing
                    of
                    this webpage) the store is now empty, abandoned and
                    becoming quite
                    derelict. <br>
                    <br>
                    Times change, again..The Valley once had three
                    thriving downtown
                    business districts; Waverly, Sayre and Athens. The
                    community at large
                    has evolved and changed over the years, and Elmira
                    street has become
                    the new "main" shopping district for the Valley as a
                    whole, and the
                    downtown shopping districts have struggled to
                    survive. They still have
                    businesses! most of them quite sucessful..but not <span

                  style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><big> as
                    there once was, and it's unlikely the downtown
                    shopping districts will
                    ever regain their past capacity, since Elmira street
                    has taken over the
                    main shopping role for the Valley. Which means that
                    today, a large
                    commercial store space
                    in downtown Sayre is simply not needed, the old
                    Newberry's building is
                    now simply a relic of the mid-20th century way of
                    life, no longer
                    needed or wanted.<br>
                    <br>
                    Many people have begun wondering about, and
                    discussing that lost
                    downtown Sayre park. Some early discussion about the
                    possibility of
                    "restoring the park" first <a
                      href="http://www.railroad.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=89&amp;t=9806">hit
the
                      internet</a> about 2005. For several years it was
                    just a wistfull
                    thought, but in 2012 two things changed that
                    *really* got a head of
                    steam going
                    under this idea! The building became empty, and a
                    facebook group really
                    got the idea of
                    the park going! with a huge amount of community

                    <br>
                    What a great idea it would be to *restore*
                    Desmond Street Park! The Newberry's store is not
                    needed, and the
                    businesses that do remain in downtown Sayre could
                    really benefit from
                    the beautification of Sayre this park could bring!
                    The park would mean
                    a much more attractive downtown, which would draw
                    more people, which
                    could only be good
                    for business! If some considered the removal of the
                    park in the first
                    place a "mistake"..the time has come to fix that
                    mistake! <img style="width: 15px; height: 15px;"

                    below are all the known (so far) photos of the
                    original Desmond Street
                    Park..most of these photos are believed to be public
                    domain. I will
                    give the photographer name, if known. (most are so
                    old the
                    photographer's name has been lost to history)</big></big>

                      park, looking East,
                      showing the "Sayre Canteen" during World War One.
                      During both WWI and
                      WWII the LV moved a huge amount of troops via
                      "troop trains" from the
                      Mid-West to New York City, where the troops
                      shipped out to the European
                      battlefields. (and the LV also brought the boys
                      back home after the
                      war!) The LV, Sayre, and the Valley community at
                      large hosted
                      "canteens" for all the troops as they passed
                      through Sayre, offering
                      free food, drinks and refreshments. The photo

                      Canteen during WWI as troops lined up in Sayre.

                      In October 1959, the

                      was bulldozed, and the Newberry's building began

                      that particular project fell-through, due to
                      circumstances beyond the
                      control of the Historical Society, so for now
                      there are no specific
                      plans for a locomotive display in Sayre..but it
                      could still happen!<br>

                      unknown,
                      Sayre turned the railroad
                      down! and the
                      locomotive went to scrap with the rest of them..If
                      the big Wyoming had
                      been preserved in the park, today it would be the

                      Steam locomotive, but sadly it was not to be..<br>

                      this kind of
                      preservation could still
                      happen! It would have to be a LV diesel locomotive
                      this time, since no
                      LV steam locomotives survive, but thats ok..A
                      diesel is still a fine
                      specimen for a town park! many locomotives are

                      today, and many are still operating with

                      sixty years after they were built..But! they can't
                      operate
                      forever..eventually, probably soon in the coming
                      years, most of them
                      will be retired..and many will still be scrapped!
                      The time is perfect

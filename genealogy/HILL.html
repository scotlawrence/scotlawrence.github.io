                      My Grandmother was a Waverly Highschool teacher in
                      the late 1950's and
                      early 60's.<br>
                      She taught English at WHS from about 1955 to 1964.
                      If you went to WHS
                      during those years,<br>
                      you probably had "Mrs. Lawrence" as your English
                      teacher! Many of my
                      Dad's classmates<br>
                      still remember their teacher "Mrs. Lawrence"
                      today..My Dad graduated
                      from Waverly Highschool in 1959,<br>
                      and he led a tour of some of his classmates around
                      their old highschool
                      (now Elm Street school) during<br>
                      their 50th highschool reunion in 2009. I found an
                      on-line article about
                      the class of '59 reunion, <br>
                      and my Dad, and Grandmother were mentioned: <a

                      highschool to his
                      classmates was a great thrill for him, <br>
                      and he really enjoyed the reunion. (Dad worked at

                      in Barton, NY in
                      1871.<br>
                      He died in nearby Waverly in 1952, and is buried
                      at the East Waverly
                      Cemetery.<br>
                      He Married (11) Grace TOMPKINS.<br>
                      <br>
                      They had only two children, my Grandmother
                      Genevieve, and her brother
                      Albert Jr.<br>
                      Albert Jr, my Dad's "Uncle Al" was never married,
                      and had no children.</span></span><small><span

                      Genevieve married Daniel Lawrence, and they had

                      My father and uncle. The Hill's and the Lawrence's
                      lived in Waverly for
                      the entire 20th century,<br>
                      and several of us are still there today.<br>

                      Today (January 2010) there are only five living
                      descendants of Albert

                      (my Dad passed away last August)<br>
                      thats it..only five descendants of my Hill line,
                      and none of us carry
                      the HILL name.<br>

                      <br>
                      Im sure there must be other HILL relatives of mine
                      out in the world
                      somewhere, distant cousins, the descendants of my
                      probable great great
                      grand uncles and such, but if there are, I am not
                      yet aware of any. (im
                      not yet aware of the great great grand uncles
                      either! ;) but im sure
                      some existed.)<br>
                      <br>
                      I have had a difficult time tracing the HILL's,
                      because so little is
                      known
                      about them.<br>
                      All my Dad knew was the name of his Grandfather,
                      Albert Senior. My Dad
                      showed me Albert's grave when we did our first
                      cemetery tour in April
                      2009. (I dont have the Hill's added to my cemetery
                      page yet..coming
                      soon!)<br>
                      <br>
                      When I began my Genealogy project in 2009, that
                      was all I knew..My
                      Grandmother Genevieve Hill,<br>
                      and her parents names, Albert Hill Sr. and his
                      wife Grace Tompkins, my
                      Dad's grandparents.<br>
                      thats it..nothing else was known.<br>
                      <br>
                      (My Dad told me his Grandmother's surname was
                      spelled "Tompeakins" he
                      was quite sure that was correct..<br>
                      I have since discovered it was most
                      likely Tompkins..sorry Dad! ;)<br>
                      <br>
                      I found some HILL headstones at the Emory Chapel
                      Cemetery in Barton,
                      about 2 miles from where<br>
                      I grew up, but I dont yet know if those HILL's are
                      related to me, but
                      it seems likely they would be, <br>
                      considering that my Great Grandfather
                      Albert Sr. was born in Barton! and Barton is not a
                      big place!<br>
                      it seems probable that all the "Barton Hill's" and
                      "Waverly Hill's"
                      would be related.<br>
                      <br>
                      Here is a list of the HILL headstones located at
                      the Emory Chapel
                      cemetery in Barton, NY:<br>
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      As I said, its seems highly likely I am related to
                      these Hill's, but I
                      havent yet been able to make<br>
                      the connection..<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      One Hill relic remains in Waverly to this day, and
                      hopefully for many
                      years to come.<br>

                      <br>
                      (Actually he is my <span style="font-style:
                        italic;">Grand</span>
                      Uncle..my Grandmother Genevieve's brother..Al is
                      my Father's uncle.)<br>
                      My whole life, he was known as "Uncle Al"..so I
                      have always called him
                      that too.<br>
                      Im not sure when the sign was first
                      painted..sometime in the 1960's I
                      believe. Al had an appliance/TV repair shop right
                      there on the corner
                      of Broad &amp; Clark
                      for many years. Al passed away in 2005, at the age
                      of 97!<br>
                      He lived out his last years at the Elizabeth
                      Square apartments at
                      Fulton &amp; Broad street.<br>
                      He walked around downtown Waverly daily until his
                      final days. nearly
                      100 years as a Waverly resident!<br>
                      <br>
                      Since Al's passing in 2005, someone has repainted
                      and restored his
                      sign! it was quite
                      faded before that..<br>

                      I knew, the name of
                      my Great Grandfather (10) Albert L. Hill Sr. <br>
                      I began digging into records. I found some census
                      data that shows
                      Albert Sr.'s parents!<br>
                      <br>
                      The parents of Albert Hill Sr. are Charles HILL,
                      born about 1836 in NY
                      or PA,<br>

                      And I have some data to suggest ancestors further

                      connections are<br>
                      unconfirmed. So far, my possible HILL ancestry
                      looks like this:<br>
                      <br>
                      7. - John HILL (1751-1834) and Rhoda HUNT<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John came to
                      Tioga NY in 1793 [255]<br>

                      6. - Chauncey HILL (b. 1791) and Lucy SEXTON.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there were
                      two Chauncey HILL's in
                      Owego, NY, in 1860, one born about 1815 in
                      Vermont,<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characterized
                      as the "town drunk"
                      or something of the like. [300] and the other
                      Chauncey HILL, <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; born 1791,
                      who is possibly my
                      ancestor.)<br>
                      <br>
                      5. - Charles HILL (b. 1836) and Frances SHELP.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (from here
                      down, my ancestry is
                      confirmed..it is NOT yet confirmed that Charles

                    face="Arial">The diesel invasion began, slowly at
                    first, in the 1920's as small diesel switchers began
                    appearing on American railroads. The trend continued
                    gradually through the 1920's and 30's and up to
                    World War Two.&nbsp; But the diesels were few and
                    still mostly confined to switcher duty, and steam
                    power on the mainlines remained essentially
                    unchallenged up to and through the war years. But
                    immediately after the war the diesel invasion
                    switched into high-gear, as diesel locomotives began
                    replacing all steam, including mainline steam.
                    Ramping up in the late 1940's, the diesel invasion
                    would replace virtually all steam power in less than
                    a decade.<br>
                    <br>
                    The EMD FT was introduced in 1939, and because of
                    wartime restrictions, was the only road freight
                    diesel produced during WWII.</font></font></font><font

                    Alco and Baldwin were restricted to only building
                    steam locomotives during the war. But right after
                    the war Alco introduced its competitor to the FT,
                    the "Alco-GE 1500",&nbsp; 1,500 horsepower, later to
                    be known as the FA1, powered by Alcos new 244

                        for promotional purposes. The model designation
                        "FA" was not used for the FA1 or FA2's until

                        DL-202 and DL-203, which were the "Black Maria"

                        FA1) and no "production" Black Marias were ever
                        built, only the demonstrator set.<br>

                        The Demonstrator set, 1500, 1501 and 1502, were
                        built as part of the GM&amp;O order, however,
                        when new they were briefly painted in the Alco
                        demonstrator scheme and were sent on a 46 day
                        shake-down tour on the D&amp;H in early 1946.
                        They were then repainted into GM&amp;O colors,
                        renumbered to GM&amp;O 700, B1 and 701, and were
                        at work on the GM&amp;O by May 1946. (The tour
                        on the D&amp;H and the delayed delivery to the

                        GM&amp;O. The first 36 GM&amp;O units all had

                        1946, those early styling cues were deleted, and

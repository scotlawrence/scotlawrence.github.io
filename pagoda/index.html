                            Delaware Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad
                            built its mainline across
                            New York State to Buffalo in the early
                            1880's. Many new towns were now
                            on the expanded DL&amp;W mainline, and each
                            new town needed a depot.
                            The Lackawanna designed a new style of depot
                            for many of these New York
                            state towns, a style which would become a
                            DL&amp;W icon. The "Pagoda
                            Style" depot was first built around 1883 for
                            the new&nbsp; expansion to
                            Buffalo, (and the style was also then used
                            for some Pennsylvania and
                            New Jersey depots as well.) but it is most
                            strongly associated with the
                            DL&amp;W of the Southern Tier and Western
                            NY. These were "combination"
                            depots, which acted as both passenger
                            stations and freight stations,
                            and had facilities for both under one roof.<br>
                            <br>
                            A total of 31 of these depots were built by
                            the DL&amp;W, and at least
                            5 more were on the Erie!<br>
                            This makes a total of 36 known Pagoda
                            depots. Of those 36, Ten still
                            survive in the year 2010,<br>

                            There is also one modern full-size Pagoda

                            of the
                            DL&amp;W Pagodas, 20 out of 31, were in New
                            York State, on the mainline<br>
                            extension to Buffalo that was built in 1880,
                            1881 and 1882.<br>
                            <br>
                            It is believed most, if not all, of the New
                            York state pagoda depots
                            were built in 1883.<br>
                            More details on that at the bottom of the
                            page.<br>
                            <br>
                            Most of these depots were in use by the
                            DL&amp;W from the early 1880's
                            through the late 1950's, Eighty years of
                            service with the railroad. In
                            1960 the DL&amp;W merged with the Erie
                            railroad to form the Erie
                            Lackawanna, and much of DL&amp;W mainline
                            was abandoned and ripped up
                            across New York State. Today, only one
                            (Atlanta, NY) of the surviving
                            Pagoda depots is next to active rails, but
                            for the rest, its been 50
                            years since they have seen a train pass by.
                            Several of the survivors
                            are in excellent condition, 130 years after
                            they were built! but sadly
                            a few others, while still standing, are
                            clearly near the end of the
                            line..conditions and status of all the
                            depots will be discussed below.<br>
                            <br>
                            I have always been interested in these
                            depots. I'm from Waverly, NY,
                            which was right on the DL&amp;W mainline,
                            and I was familiar with the
                            Vestal and Painted Post depots. It had been
                            in the back of my mind to
                            someday look into their history some
                            more..two things led to finally
                            getting around to it in 2010!<br>
                            <br>
                            First, <a
                              href="http://www.railroad.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;t=66261">a
                              post</a>
                            appeared on railroad.net from Tom Morin, who
                            along with his father
                            saved and moved the Wallace NY depot in
                            1969. Tom was interested in
                            learning more about the style, so he posted
                            a question on the forum.
                            Thanks Tom!<br>
                            <br>
                            Second, I am finally getting around to
                            building my garden railroad! I
                            have been considering scratch building a
                            1/29 scale depot for my
                            railroad..I considering basing it on a
                            SR&amp;RL depot, (im a huge fan
                            of the Maine 2-footers)..or I would love to
                            build a model of the Sayre
                            LV station! my hometown train station,
                            (where I spent many happy hours
                            as a teenage railfan and museum member back
                            in the 80's) but that would
                            be FAR too huge..how about a DL&amp;W pagoda
                            depot? thats perfect! its
                            unique, interesting, and local..so im going
                            to attempt to build one!
                            out of concrete..more on that later.<br>
                            <br>
                            So one day in the summer of 2010 I was
                            driving home to Rochester, NY
                            after visiting family in Waverly. I stopped
                            by Cohocton to check out
                            the Alcos on the Bath &amp; Hammondsport
                            railroad, and then I took the
                            backroads out of Cohocton, rather than get
                            back on the expressway, so I
                            could drive over to Atlanta NY to look for a
                            pagoda depot I had never
                            seen before..I drove into town, and there
                            she was!..the DL&amp;W's
                            Atlanta depot, looking a bit rough, but
                            still standing proud in fair
                            condition, naturally I had to stop for much
                            photographing! ;)<br>
                            <br>
                            Those are the various factors that led to
                            this webpage.<br>
                            <br>
                            I only knew personally of maybe three or
                            four pagoda depots..but
                            obviously there must have been more than
                            that..So I posted threads on
                            the railfan forums (links below) and the
                            DL&amp;W fans out in the
                            railfan community came through, as always,
                            with a ton of great
                            information, thanks everyone!<br>
                            <br>
                            So here is a look at the DL&amp;W Pagoda
                            depots, from East to West down
                            the DL&amp;W mainline.<br>
                            50 years after the end of The Lackawanna.<br>

                          Harold W. Russell Jr.<br>
                          <br>
                          I was able to locate copies of the magazine
                          and the book!<br>
                          (both are available for a very reasonable
                          price, email me and I will
                          tell you how/where I found them)<br>
                          Both drawings are very good, however I believe
                          the Wallace drawing is
                          better detailed<br>
                          and more accurate. (and it has dimensions,
                          while the Vestal drawing

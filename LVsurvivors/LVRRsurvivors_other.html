Faint "Lehigh Valley" lettering is visible across the top, under the
paint, and a road number is faintly visible on both sides..(you can see
the raised outline of the old lettering under the newer green
paint..the lettering was simply painted over, but thankfully not
removed before painting..) &nbsp;<br>
It is LV car 94140... <br>
looking through &nbsp;"Lehigh Valley Railroad Passenger Cars, photo and
diagram book No.1 " LV 94140 ended its LV career as a "service
car"..its a coach converted to work train service at Sayre.. <br>
94140 began life as an 800 or 900 series coach, built by Pullman in
1914. <br>
I dont yet know its original number.. <br>

This mystery LV coach perhaps once operated with the Clinhfield RR

"One of these LV coaches ended up on the Clinchfield ex ursion train.
It ended up at the Kentucky Railway Museum. It was later sold to a

wood sided cars.&nbsp; <a

some were used for storage by a grain facility.<br>
Update on the Manchester boxcars: <br>
One of the steel cars was scrapped in 2007, and one of the wood cars
was moved to nearby Victor.<br>
(the wood car is currently (October 2009) sitting on the old NYC
remnant in Victor)<br>
The second wood car in Manchester was scrapped in September, 2008.<br>
This leaves three steel LV boxcars in Manchester, and no wood cars, as
of October 2009.<br>

      <p>The Wilkes Barre was last known as the "Julia C. Moran" and is
believed
to now be in Mexico. <br>
While trying to find out more info on the Wilkes Barre, I discovered
there was a much earlier tug also <br>
named the "Julia C. Moran", built in 1906! </p>
      <p>There seems to be some confusion over the tugboat name "Julia
C. Moran" <br>
because some on-line tugboat sources indicate the Julia was built new
for Moran in 1951 (by Jakobson) <br>
So was the LV's Wilkes Barre actually a THIRD Julia C. Moran? </p>
      <p>First, there was the 1906 Julia C. Moran, also mentioned in a
1916 New
York times article available on-line. <br>
That first Julia is not in question. <br>
The question concerns the second, and possibly third Julia. <br>
Was there only one 1950's Julia? or Two? <br>
Was the first Julia built new for Moran, and the second Julia was the
Wilkes Barre? <br>
or were they one and the same? (which would mean the Julia was not
built new for Moran, but was built for the LV) <br>
or was the LV Wilkes Barre never actually a Julia C. Moran at all?
and that info is simply wrong?? <br>
it is all uncertain at this point. <br>

Shops Parade Model!<br>
      </font></font></u></p>
      <p>Exciting news! October 2010.<br>
It has been known, from photographic evidence, that the Sayre Shops
built at least two large, scale models<br>
of steam locomotives, believed to be for parade floats, and/or perhaps
for a World's Fair.<br>
One of the models is of LVRR 4-6-2 Atlantic No. 2479.<br>
The prototype No. 2479 was built at Sayre about 1911, as a member of
the LV's final class of Atlantics,<br>
(and the only class of Atlantics "home built" by the LV)<br>
A scale model of the locomotive was also built at Sayre, presumably
around the same timeframe, and a photo of the model,<br>
as a parade float, is known:<br>
      </p>
      <p><img alt=""
 src="http://i165.photobucket.com/albums/u45/scottychaos/Black-Diamond/700-2479-model.jpg"
 height="342" width="542" border="0"></p>
      <p>The fate of the Sayre Shops models has been unknown, until
now! one of them has been discovered intact!<br>
In October 2010, "Dominic" posted a question, and photos, about a large
steam locomotive model he owns!<br>
see this thread for photos and details:<br>
      <a
 href="http://forums.railfan.net/forums.cgi?board=LV;action=display;num=1287897981">http://forums.railfan.net/forums.cgi?board=LV;action=display;num=1287897981</a><br>
This is clearly the Sayre built model of Atlantic 2479! almost 100
years old!<br>
Some sleuthing on that thread theorizes that the model was perhaps on
display at the 1915 Worlds Fair in San Francisco, California.<br>
Perhaps after the fair, it never left Califorina, and has remained
there to this day.<br>
Dominic never did respond with his plans for the model, but hopefully
it will remain intact.<br>
If anyone knows if Dominic ever sold it, and where the model is
currently located, please let me know!<br>
Legions of LV fans are very interested in it!<br>
Ideally it would be great if it could return to a LV museum, ideally in
      <a href="http://www.sayrehistoricalsociety.org/">Sayre</a>, the
place of its birth,<br>
but just the fact that it exists is amazing! :)<br>

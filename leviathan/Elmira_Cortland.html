            was the Auburn branch which meandered westward through the
            countryside
            through such places as Plymouth, Beaver Meadow, Otselic
            Center and DeRuyter.
            This line was originally intended to be built to Buffalo,
            but never got
            beyond a remote community in Cayuga County known as Scipio
            Summit or Merrifield.</font></font></b><font

              the
              NY&amp;OM went into the hands of receivers on Sept. 19,
              1873 and a multitude
              of problems resulted in the entire line being shut down on
              Feb. 27, 1875
              for several months. The Auburn branch was also closed down
              until April
              1, 1875 when the Utica, Ithaca &amp; Elmira Railroad
              leased and operated
              it for a year, or until May 1, 1876 when the Midland was
              able to resume
              operation on its own. Since 1872, the U.I. &amp; E. had
              had trackage rights
              over the Midland between Cortland and DeRuyter and
              apparently saw an opportunity
              to extend its horizons to Norwich. It already had made an
              important connection
              with the New York Central at Canastota through acquisition
              of the Cazenovia,
              Canastota &amp; DeRuyter Railroad. Some improvements were
              made between
              Norwich and DeRuyter and by early April, 1875, the UI
              &amp; E was operating
              two daily eastbound passenger trains between Cortland and
              Norwich; one
              morning train between DeRuyter and Cortland and an evening
              westbound train
              from Norwich to Cortland. But since the UI &amp; E only
              operated the line
              between DeRuyter and Norwich for a year, it does not
              appear it gave serious
              consideration to purchasing it. In fact, it was rumored
              they wanted to
              rip up the line east of DeRuyter and build a new line
              through Georgetown
              to Randallsville. This was never done, however, and the
              Midland continued
              sporadic service between Norwich and Cortland until 1880.
              Norwich to DeRuyter
              was dismantled in 1882. The 19 1/2 miles from DeRuyter to
              Cortland was
              preserved through leases until it was purchased outright
              by the Elmira,
              Cortland &amp; Northern Railroad which was the immediate
              antecedent of
              the Lehigh Valley. The so-called "western extension"
              between Freeville
              and Scipio Summit was operated under lease by the UI &amp;
              E between 1873
              and 1876 when it was sold to the newly-organized Ithaca,
              Auburn &amp; Western.
              This line was extended to Auburn in 1889, but only lasted
              three years.</font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font

              Midland had

              where it went back on to its own tracks to Scipio Summit.
              What follows
              is a series of articles concerning an excursion from
              Norwich to Ithaca.
              Railroad excursions in those days were very popular with
              the public and
              they were excellent fundraisers for local organizations
              such as the Odd
              Fellows. Canaswacta Lodge of Norwich sponsored many such
              excursions in
              the 1870s. One of the most ambitious ones was over the
              Auburn branch to
              Ithaca. The railroad west of Cortland (originally the
              Ithaca &amp; Cortland)
              was completed in 1872, the original western terminus being
              on the Cornell
              University campus. The campus station was abandoned in
              1876 when the UI
              &amp; E was completed to Elmira.</font></font></b><font

              second
              article states the train was pulled by the locomotive
              "Leviathan," an 0-6-6T
              built by Mason (Const. No. 675) in February, 1875. This
              engine had a cog
              on the front axle to negotiate the nine percent grade of
              the proposed extension
              of the UI &amp; E from the Cornell Campus down Cascadilla
              Gorge and across
              town to the Ithaca &amp; Athens Railroad station. This
              project fell through
              after the death of its chief promoter, Ezra Cornell. Not
              needed for its
              intended purpose and after numerous mechanical problems it
              was returned
              to the builder.</font></font></b><font

              which had been carefully packed at home, had scarcely
              taken possession
              of the grove, when a drenching shower set in, which caused
              a commotion
              among those who had assembled among the pines on the
              border of Fall Creek;
              and, despite the good humor which prevailed upon its
              commencement, the
              party was soon compelled to vacate the woods, while most
              the dainties which
              they had hoped to there enjoy were water soaked and
              useless. Before they
              had reached the University buildings, another and more
              severe shower set
              in, accompanied with heavy thunder. The nearest houses

              them; while the University buildings were thrown open to
              the dripping delegation

              they had opportunities

              library, museum

              there exhibited.
              Among the attractions at the library were the flags won by

              the allowed their
              competitors to win the game. On the ninth inning the game
              was a tie, and

              a miscellaneous assortment of ladies hats, shawls and
              table linen, which
              had been hung from the windows to dry, and the ground was
              strewn with the

              it was off at
              last, in the relief of those who werenow thinking of home.
              When near Freeville
              Junction, another terrific storm burst upon the party,
              accompanied by thunder,
              lightening and hail. Those who occupied the platform car
              were compelled
              to vacate their seats, and seek shelter in the other
              coaches, which were
              now more than crowded, and through the roofs of some of
              which the water
              was dripping upon the heads of their occupants, who, with
              umbrellas spread,

              no further use for it. Before reaching home, the storm had
              ceased, and
              the moon shone out clear and pleasant. At 11:30 in the
              evening the train
              stopped at Broad Street crossing in this village, and the
              party dispersed

                      downtown Ithaca up to Cornell University. The line

                      proposal was Ezra Cornell, who had a large
                      financial investment in local railroads. His idea
                      was to link downtown Ithaca with the university
                      campus without having to make the long tedious
                      walk up the hill. The idea was not
                      enthusiastically supported by the trustees of
                      Cornell University or the community, and
                      after&nbsp; Ezra Cornell's death on Dec. 9, 1874,
                      the project was abandoned - but not before the
                      "Leviathan" was delivered. At one point it was
                      used on the Auburn branch of the New York &amp;
                      Oswego Midland which the U.I.&amp; E. had leased
                      for a short time. But it was eventually returned
                      to the builder, after only a year or so of
                      operation in Central New York.</font></font></font>

                      and became their #24,&nbsp; and retained the name

                      size="+1">"The information I have on the
                      "Leviathan" comes from a book I own, "A History of
                      Railroads in Tompkins County" published in 1977 by
                      DeWitt Historical Society of Ithaca. "Leviathan"
                      was not owned by the Lehigh Valley, at least not
                      directly. As the article on the Norwich excursion
                      states, she was returned to Mason. This was in
                      1876, just one year after being built. UI&amp;E
                      became the Elmira, Cortland &amp; Northern in
                      1884; EC&amp;N became LV property in 1905. So
                      "Leviathan" was not transferred to LV through
                      purchase of EC&amp;N. The book doesn't mention
                      what became of "Leviathan" after it was returned
                      to Mason; maybe LV acquired it later in the
                      locomotive's life, although I would think the book
                      would state if this were so. This could explain
                      the clipping that you have that says LV had
                      "Leviathan". Or maybe the clipping was just
                      assuming (incorrectly) that any locomotive owned
                      by a LV predecessor was therefore owned by Lehigh
                      Valley as well. "History of Railroads in Tompkins
                      County" has a picture of "Leviathan", but it
                      appears to be the same one that you have."</font></font></font>

                      is the exact overall color used..it was likely
